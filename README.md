# notes

Compilations of my thinkings, learnings, lessons, and my PoV to others' blogs, incidents, experiences, etc

## Contents

Mostly about database, distributed systems, application integrity, application performance and/or scalability, etc.
This is not intended to be a really comprehensive list/blogs, but instead just writings to satisfy myself,
and if possible, for others to learn.

## why as repo?

1. I am quite used to markdown. Not advanced level, but if anything, I can always go check [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
2. IMHO markdown is better to write than HTML/CSS, and I don't want to code/manage at all for this.
3. Other forums/writing platforms use paywall, reducing the capability to read when not logged-in.
4. For discussions/comments, github already provides [discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) or can also use [issues](https://github.com/aarondwi/notes/issues).
