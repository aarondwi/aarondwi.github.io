# Not Yet, if ever

## technical

1. Distributed Tracing is basically best-effort distributed transactions, one to do the work, one to log
2. Sensible default, but configurable
3. Kubernetes because google buys a big enough hardware for only one app
4. "Lots of features" is good for services, "do one `large` thing well" is good for libraries
5. Is "infra as code" a code? If yes, how to test it?
6. Code to write VS to learn, or why big framework/abstraction is bad
7. Isolation in ACID is a very, very insanely expensive illusion

## non-technical

1. Stupid tech decisions and politics opening lots of new companies and job markets
2. `Machine is cheap, dev is expensive` mantra only apply to country with high salary
